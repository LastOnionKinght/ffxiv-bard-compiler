\# FFXIV Bard Compiler



A standalone compiler that converts MIDI into \*\*FFXIV Performance-safe\*\*

scores compatible with MidiBard2 and similar tools.



\## Goals

\- Phrase-aware melody extraction (not naive pitch picking)

\- FFXIV performance constraints (note range, density, monophonic limits)

\- Score-style track layout for solo and band play

\- A smart \*\*Solo Overdriven Guitar\*\* track that can auto-switch tone



\## Planned Track Layout

\- Guitar (Solo) – Overdriven

\- Melody

\- Harmony

\- Bass

\- Arpeggio

\- Countermelody

\- Ornament



\## Scope

This project is currently a \*\*standalone compiler\*\*.

A Dalamud plugin wrapper may be added later.



\## Status

Early development – structure and core logic in progress.
